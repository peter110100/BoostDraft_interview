Overview:
This pull request introduces several improvements to the XML validation logic within our C++ application. The updated code enhances tag parsing, supports self-closing tags, improves tag name validation.

Changes:
Support for Self-Closing Tags: The XML validation now recognizes and correctly handles self-closing tags such as <tag/>.

Improved Tag Name Validation: The validation logic for tag names has been expanded to allow underscores and colons, and ensures that tag names start with a letter or an underscore.
